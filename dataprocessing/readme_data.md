# Data Preprocessing Templates for Python & R

These are academic examples of data preprocessing to prepare use in *Python* and *R*. Preprocessing is key to better results in machine learning and further into deep learning.

## List of Files Used

- There are two versions of the most files. One in *Python* and the other in *R*.
- *Data.csv* : an example spreadsheet to test the templates

### Significant Libraries Used

- **scikit-learn** will be main library for machine learning in a variety of projects. [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). These templates will facilitate most of the libraries capability.
- **numpy** used to harness arrays and computation into multi-dimensional spaces
- **pandas** used for data munging and preparation
- **matplotlib** used for graphical representation of data
